This is the harder version of the fourth assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we had to create another fun and interactive game for web browsers which used the jQuery library to update the HTML page.

## Getting Started
**Pokemon Battle Game**

To start, choose a Pokemon to be your partner. This Pokemon will be your partner for the whole game. The unchosen Pokemon will become challengers. Choose one to challenge and click the "Battle" Button. Defeat all the challengers to win the game!
